      I am a beginner and this will be my first race, any pointers?

      Make sure your car passes technical inspection. If you are not running rally tires,
      increase your tire pressure to prevent a debead. And most importantly, HAVE FUN!

      Is a racing license required to practice or race?
    </template>
    <template #answer>
      A racing license is not required to race at our events. If you are planning on
      getting points for the California Rally Series RallyCross championship, you will
      need to sign up for a CRS membership prior to racing the event. National events
      do require an SCCA membership to participate in.

      I don’t have an AWD/4WD vehicle, can my car still race?
    </template>
    <template #answer>
      AWD/4WD is not a requirement to race. All vehicles are welcome to race as long
      as they pass technical inspection.

      My friend or family member wants to watch, how much is it for them?
    </template>
    <template #answer>
      Spectating is free at all of our events. If entering through the front gate
      at Glen Helen, let the gate attendant know that they’re there for the RallyCross.
      You may also get into the rallycross by the side gate but please remain off the course.
