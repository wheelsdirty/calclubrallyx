      <h2>
        Safety:
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Safety Steward of record has final say in all safety related issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          All drivers and passengers must wear a Snell 2005 or better helmet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cars must pass a safety (tech) inspection before being allowed on course.
          If the Event Chairman after consultation with the Event Safety Steward
          determines at his discretion that a vehicle cannot safely negotiate the
          course, it may be excluded.
        </li>
        <li>
          Course is subject to immediate change if degradation is determined to cause a safety concern.
        </li>
        <li>
          Speed limit is 5mph in the paddock.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please be aware that this is a fairly isolated location with limited
          emergency access. Some cell phone services have been determined to work
          and the event management will have working communications. If a medical
          or security issue should occur, whether related to the RallyX or not,
          notify the Event Management to ascertain the problem.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring drinking water and food. Establishments are far enough away to
          make a trip off the site inconvenient.
        </li>
        <li>
          Photographers must stay within a normal spectator area unless given
          specific permission by the Event Chair or Safety Steward. Permission
          will at least require a spotter to accompany the photographer. All
          photographers must check-in with registration/timing and give the
          organizer contact information to receive photo(s) and/or video(s) for
          event use and promotions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Parking and driver paddoc is no longer allowed near the grid area (along the fence).
        </li>
        <li>
          No spectating near the entry and exit points of the course area
          (don’t stand near the gate).
        </li>
        <li>
          Children must be accompanied with a parent, guardian, or care-taker at all times.
          Children and dogs will not be allowed in the grid area. Dogs must leashed at all times.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heavy machine operators must use equipment responsibly!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Passengers
      </h3>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise noted passengers (navigators) will be allowed unrestricted.
        Passengers must be at least 12 years old and have signed the SCCA waiver.
        Competitors who have not complete all of their runs can not be a passenger.
      </p>
      <h3>
        ATVs, Mountain Bikes, etc
      </h3>
      <p>
        Personal vehicles of these types are not allowed in the grid area and can only
        be operated on course with the permission of event management. These personal
        vehicles are allowed in the paddock and outside of the event area, however extreme
        caution should be used in their operation.

        Scoring and Prizes
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We will be targeting 6 runs per entry.
        </li>
        <li>
          Scored time will be the accumulation of all runs, including penalties.
        </li>
        <li>
          A 2 second penalty will be given if a course pylon is upset or totally displaced
          (including post finish cones).
        </li>
        <li>
          A 10 second penalty will be given for each missed gate or off course.
        </li>
        <li>
          Starting before receiving signal from the started will be considered an
          off course penalty.
        </li>
        <li>
          A 2 second penlty will be given to any pylon hit after the course finish
          and/or unsafe transit back to grid.
        </li>
        <li>
          warning will be given for unsafe transit back to grid, than a 10 second
          penalty will be added for continued unsafe transit.
        </li>
        <li>
          A 3rd time will disqualify the driver and no subsequent runs will be given.
        </li>
        <li>
          For a mechanical DNF the driver will be given the slowest competitive time of
          a driver’s normal group +10 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Accumulation of 10 cones over all runs will result in the driver being disqualified
          from the event, i.e. the driver will not be allowed subsequent runs.
        </li>
        <li>
          1st, 2nd, and 3rd place positions in each race class will be awarded a trophy custom.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        End of season trophies will be given to the top 3 drivers of each race class.
        1st place champion in each race class will receive a custom CalClub RallyCross champion jacket.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event of a tie for season championship points standings, the total
        cones hit for the entire season will be the tie breaker. The driver with the
        least amount of cones hit for the entire season will take the lead. This tie
        break situation will only pertain to the top 3 positions of each class.
