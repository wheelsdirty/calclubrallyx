    <p>
      RallyCross is often described as “autocross-on-dirt”, another good description is
      “performance rally, shrunk”. Course design is similar to autocross, focusing on driver
      skill and car handling, rather than speed and horsepower. Several laps are taken through
      the pylon defined route, but unlike autocross and more reminiscent of performance rally,
      every course lap is added as your cumulative time. Penalties for displacing cones are the
      familiar “plus 2 seconds”, but there are gate penalties of 10 seconds rather than being
      issued a DNF.
