      Definition
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>“Grass Roots”</strong> means it is designed to be very low cost
      and easy to qualify for. Every measure practical is taken to keep the
      entry fees as low as possible. Speeds are kept at a level such that everyday
      street cars can be used without additional (expensive) safety equipment. Prize
      budgets are kept low and encouragement is given to drivers of all skill levels
      to participate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>“Work/Run”</strong> means that every entrant is required to “work” a
      shift. A work shift will usually entail manning the course to reset pylons,
      working a radio to call in penalties or safety issues, or working some other
      organizational part of the event. A required work shift for all d rivers keeps
      the costs low and instills event quality pride in the drivers themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>“SCCA event”</strong> means the event is insured and sanctioned by
      the national body called Sports Car Club of America. The liability insurance
      provided is required by all venue owners and most promoter organizations. The
      standardized set of safety regulations is also very helpful in putting on a
      quality, safe event.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Preparation
    </h2>
    <p>
      Quite simply, be prepared. First and foremost arrive with enough time to get
      yourself completely ready. This usually means 1hr+ before your work/run group.
    </p>
    <p>
      Know you class, desired numbers and have $$ ready before going to registration
    </p>
    <p>
      Registration is a busy time and a notorious bottle neck. If you are pre-reged
      and pre-paid it takes all of 15seconds to check you in. If you’re a day of,
      prepared with your $$, class and number request it takes about 1 minute. If you’re
      not sure of your class and didn’t think about a number it can take 10minutes while
      everyone behind you gets impatient. Please do your homework in the days before the
      event and come PREPARED. I would much rather spend 30minutes on the phone with you
      figuring out a class than 5minutes at registration while the event start time ticks
      closer and closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have your car tech-ready before going to tech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything loose needs to be gone and car needs to be in ready to run condition.
      Including race wheels, car numbers in place and helmet. You should pre-check your
      car for all the common fail items like loose battery and missing lug nuts. Bring
      proper numbers! Tape sucks, especially at speed covered in mud. There are plenty
      of inexpensive options that are highly visible and look great on your vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have your car completely ready to go before getting called to grid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pay attention to the schedule of the event. Do not leave your car on your trailer
      while you work if you know you’ll need to immediately drive at the end of shift.
      Don’t leave your car unprepared for racing until the last minute. Don’t go wondering
      off to eat lunch if your group is coming up. Being late to grid will result in lost runs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have your body completely ready to go before being called to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is VERY important. Be prepared to check in for work at your shift, the event
      can not proceed if we don’t get workers checked in and on duty. If you are driving
      immediately before your work shift, don’t disappear to put you car on a trailer, or
      grab some lunch, or chat with your buddies. Park the car, grab a water bottle and check in.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Don’t Do’s !!!
    </h2>
    <p>
      Don’t arrive late or unprepared.<br>
      This was well covered above, but unprepared drivers/workers is by far the biggest
      event delay. Event delays means less runs, more work and higher costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don’t be a Paddock speeder<br>
      The paddock is by far the most dangerous area at the venue. There are children, dogs,
      other cars and motorcycles everywhere. Keep your speed down. Zipping around the paddock
      or the access roads at more than a walking pace will not be tolerated and can lead to
      disqualification or removal from site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Access Road hooning<br>
      Please be respectful when coming to and going from the venue. Note our venue is bordered'
      on two sides by the county sheriff. Our cars are very conspicuous so it’s not hard to tell
      where we are coming from, even 50 miles from the venue. If even a few drivers behave
      inappropriately it will compromise our future venue prospects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roaming the facility<br>
      We do not have access rights to the entire Glen Helen facility. The venue generally
      does not charge us a gate fee because it is understood that we will not wonder the
      other paid sites. This includes the MotorCross tracks, the RC track and the Trophy
      Truck track, whether they’re in use or not. Gross violations of this will lead to
      disqualification and/or suspensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alcohol<br>
      As per our sanction agreement alcohol is not allowed at our facility during the event.
      This prohibition is in effect from gates open until the final work group is cleared
      from duty. Specifically even if individual drivers have completed their day, alcohol
      is not allowed until the event is complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      On course shenanigans<br>
      Please be respectful of your fellow competitors. Excess driving aggression leads to
      accelerated deterioration of the course, unnecessary pylon counts and dangerous
      conditions for both the drivers and course workers. The premise of the event it
      to complete the course in minimal time while avoiding penalties. If drives are not
      meeting this premise they will be told to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over night annoyance<br>
      Please be respectful of your camping neighbors, which include fellow RallyXers,
      MotorCross drivers and the venue management. Excess noise, unnecessary fires or
      late night indiscretions will not be tolerated. Poor overnight behavior can lead
      to us losing our overnight privileges or even the venue entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just don’t be dumb.<br>
      Not everything can be anticipated and listed. So please use GOOD judgment before
      engaging in ANY questionable behavior. Poor judgment is usually at the root of
      all safety incidents and personal conflicts. We’re all out here to have fun,
      respect the concept that YOUR fun should not in any way take away from others’.
